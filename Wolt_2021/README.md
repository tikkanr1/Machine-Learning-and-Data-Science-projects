**Goal**  
Predicting future orders for Wolt using Wolt's order history in autumn 2020.

**Approach**  
Two different approaches:  
  -Using Facebook's fbprophet tool  
  -Using XGBregressor and GridSearch to try and optimize parameters  

**Results**  
The results showed that the much easier to use fbprophet produced much better results  
than the other approach which included parameter optimization.
