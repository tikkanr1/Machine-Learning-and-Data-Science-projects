**Goal**  
Analyzing the daily activity of FitBit activity tracker users.

**The data**  
The FitBit tracker dataset consists of personal tracker data collected from 30 eligible FitBit users between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. 
The data includes minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. 
The data is available at https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit. 

**Approach**  
The objective of this study was to analyze users' activity and behaviour using statistical methods and to compare
their activity levels with the recommendations set by authorities and non-profit
organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO).

**Results**  

Most of the participants showed unhealthy levels of activity and sleep during the test period, and some participants showed very
unhealthy lifestyles. The participants with least healthy lifestyles were both inactive and sleeping too little. The results are 
in agreement with the presented studies and recommendations set for activity and sleep.

While the results look promising, only 24 participants were analyzed in the
end which limits the validity of the results. In the future more participants with
regular activity logs are required to make better conclusions. With the number
of fitness trackers rising worldwide, it seems plausible to do so.
