• Numerical attributes:  
– “T" is the air temperature, in degrees Celsius, 2 meters above the earth’s. surface.  
– “Po" is the atmospheric pressure at weather station level, in millimeters of mercury.  
– “P" is the atmospheric pressure reduced to mean sea level, in millimeters of mercury.  
– “Ff" is the mean wind speed at a height of 10-12 meters above the earth’s surface, in meters per second.  
– “Tn" is the minimum air temperature, in degrees Celsius, over the past day.  
– “Tx" is the maximum air temperature, in degrees Celsius, over the past day.  
– “W" is the horizontal visibility, in km.  
– “Td" is the dewpoint temperature at a height of 2 meters above the earth’s surface, in degrees Celsius.  
– “U" is the relative humidity, in percentage, 2 meters above the earth’s surface.  
– “OBSERVED" is a categorical variable, where 0 (not dry) indicates that the amount of precipitation was  
more than 0.3 millimeters, and 1 (dry) indicates that there was little or no precipitation.
