**Goal**  
Predicting humidity using given weatherdata.

**Approach**  
Predict humidity by minimizing dimensionality with PCA and using LinearRegression.

**Results**  
The approach showed that using just half of the maximum number of principal components available gives decent results.

However, increasing the maximum number of principal components to 12 which still is a 25% reduction, proves to be a much 
better solution.
